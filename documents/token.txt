# Code Explanation

## Description:
This document explains the functionality of the LNQToken smart contract. The contract inherits from two other OpenZeppelin contracts, ERC20Permit and Ownable, and provides the functionality of minting and burning tokens.

## Usecases:
The code serves the following use cases:
- Use case 1: Create and manage an ERC20 token called LNQToken with a symbol of LNQ.
- Use case 2: Allow the token to be mintable and set a minter address to control minting.
- Use case 3: Allow the token to be burned by the token owner or by an approved address.

## Working:
The code operates based on the following working principles:
1. The contract is constructed with the name "LNQToken" and the symbol "LNQ". It uses the ERC20Permit and Ownable contracts and sets the minter to the contract deployer.
2. The onlyMinter modifier is used to ensure that only the minter can mint new tokens.
3. The changeMintable function allows the contract owner to change whether or not the token is mintable.
4. The setMinter function allows the contract owner to set a new minter address.
5. The mint function is used by the minter to mint new tokens and requires that the token is currently mintable.
6. The burn function allows the token owner to burn their own tokens.
7. The burnFrom function allows an approved address to burn tokens on behalf of another address.

## Each Function Explanation:
1. Function changeMintable:
   - Purpose: To change the mintable state of the token.
   - Parameters: 
     - _mintable (bool): The new mintable state.
   - Return Value: None.
   - Example Usage: `changeMintable(true)`

2. Function setMinter:
   - Purpose: To set a new minter address.
   - Parameters: 
     - _minter (address): The new minter address.
   - Return Value: None.
   - Example Usage: `setMinter(0x123...)`

3. Function mint:
   - Purpose: To mint new tokens.
   - Parameters: 
     - _address (address): The address to receive the minted tokens.
     - amount (uint256): The amount of tokens to mint.
   - Return Value: None.
   - Example Usage: `mint(0x456..., 100)`

4. Function burn:
   - Purpose: To burn tokens owned by the caller.
   - Parameters: 
     - amount (uint256): The amount of tokens to burn.
   - Return Value: None.
   - Example Usage: `burn(50)`

5. Function burnFrom:
   - Purpose: To burn tokens from an approved address on behalf of another address.
   - Parameters: 
     - _address (address): The address from which to burn tokens.
     - amount (uint256): The amount of tokens to burn.
   - Return Value: None.
   - Example Usage: `burnFrom(0x789..., 75)`
